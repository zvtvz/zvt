# ZVT Project: TDD-Focused Task Rescheduling Plan
*Test-Driven Development and Specification-Driven Approach*

## 🎯 **Executive Summary: TDD-First Development Strategy**

**Current Reality**: Epic 1 has established a solid architectural foundation with comprehensive testing framework (95%+ coverage, 28,655+ lines of code). However, current task scheduling prioritizes infrastructure deployment over functional development.

**Strategic Pivot**: Reschedule all tasks to follow strict **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** methodology with **specification-driven development cycles**, deferring all infrastructure tasks as optional until functional completeness is achieved.

**Core Principle**: **"Red-Green-Refactor first, Deploy later"**

---

## 🚫 **DEFERRED TASKS - Infrastructure as Optional**

### **Production Infrastructure** ❌ **DEFERRED TO OPTIONAL PHASE**
- ❌ Production infrastructure deployment 
- ❌ Kubernetes production environment setup
- ❌ Security audit and production hardening
- ❌ Production monitoring and alerting systems
- ❌ Performance validation with real infrastructure
- ❌ Disaster recovery and backup procedures
- ❌ Load balancing and auto-scaling setup
- ❌ Production database optimization
- ❌ SSL/TLS certificate management
- ❌ Network security and firewall configuration

### **Operational Concerns** ❌ **DEFERRED TO OPTIONAL PHASE**
- ❌ Production deployment procedures
- ❌ Operational runbooks and monitoring
- ❌ Incident response and escalation procedures
- ❌ Performance benchmarking with real infrastructure
- ❌ Security penetration testing
- ❌ Compliance audit and certification
- ❌ Production support team training
- ❌ Customer onboarding infrastructure

**Rationale**: Infrastructure tasks consume significant time and resources without delivering functional value. TDD methodology prioritizes working software over operational deployment. These tasks can be completed once functional requirements are fully validated through comprehensive testing.

## 🎯 **TDD METHODOLOGY - Core Development Framework**

### **Red-Green-Refactor Cycle Framework**

#### **RED Phase: Write Failing Tests**
```python
# Example TDD Cycle for Trading Engine
def test_order_placement_should_fail_initially():
    """RED: Write test that fails because feature doesn't exist yet"""
    engine = CryptoTradingEngine()
    order = Order(symbol="BTC/USDT", side="buy", amount=0.01, price=50000)
    
    with pytest.raises(NotImplementedError):
        result = engine.place_order(order)
```

#### **GREEN Phase: Minimal Implementation**
```python
def place_order(self, order: Order) -> OrderResult:
    """GREEN: Minimal implementation to make test pass"""
    # Simplest possible implementation
    return OrderResult(order_id="test-123", status="pending")
```

#### **REFACTOR Phase: Improve Design**
```python
def place_order(self, order: Order) -> OrderResult:
    """REFACTOR: Improve implementation with better design"""
    validated_order = self._validate_order(order)
    exchange_order = self._route_to_exchange(validated_order)
    return self._track_order(exchange_order)
```

### **Specification-Driven Test Creation**

#### **Requirements → Test Cases → Implementation**
1. **Read Specification**: Extract functional requirements from existing specs
2. **Write Test Cases**: Create comprehensive test cases covering all spec requirements
3. **Run Tests (RED)**: Verify tests fail appropriately
4. **Implement Feature (GREEN)**: Write minimal code to pass tests
5. **Refactor (REFACTOR)**: Improve code quality while maintaining test success
6. **Repeat**: Move to next specification requirement

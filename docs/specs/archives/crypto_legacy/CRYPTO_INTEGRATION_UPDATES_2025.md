## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Primary Risks (Updated)
1. **Exchange API Changes** - **HIGH**: APIs evolve rapidly
   - *Mitigation*: Version management, multiple exchange support, formal partnerships

2. **Security Vulnerabilities** - **CRITICAL**: Financial system security requirements  
   - *Mitigation*: Security specialist, regular audits, compliance frameworks

3. **Performance Under Load** - **MEDIUM**: Crypto markets are highly volatile
   - *Mitigation*: Realistic targets, comprehensive load testing, backpressure control

4. **Timeline Pressure** - **MEDIUM**: 36 weeks is aggressive but realistic
   - *Mitigation*: Built-in 6-week buffer, phased delivery, scope management

### Mitigation Status: âœ… ADDRESSED
All primary risks have specific mitigation strategies and resource allocation in the updated plans.
